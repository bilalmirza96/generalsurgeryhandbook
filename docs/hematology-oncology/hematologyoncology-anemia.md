# Anemia

Margaret Wheless

---

First establish acuity: bleed or consumptive process vs slow onset anemia
- Check vitals for hypotension, tachycardia.
- Check Hgb trend from prior if available.
- Examine patient for pallor, rapid onset fatigue, AMS, feeble pulses and any signs of bleeding.
- Consider risk factors such as recent procedure, blood thinner use, falls, new medications.
- STAT repeat CBC along with haptoglobin, LDH, HFP(bilirubin) to rule out hemolysis
- If no sx/signs of acute bleeding, move onto general anemia eval below.
- Note: CBC does not accurately reflect blood loss in acute rapid bleeding scenarios so do not be falsely reassured by normal hematocrit in GI bleeds/trauma patients.

## Presentation
-	Symptoms: fatigue/malaise, dyspnea on exertion, angina (if history of CAD)
-	Signs
    -	Pallor, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, purpura, glossitis, koilonychia (in IDA)
    -	Jaundice (if hemolysis)
    -	Splenomegaly: suggests extramedullary hematopoiesis or sequestration
    -	Neurologic symptoms: suggests B12 deficiency  

## Evaluation
-	CBC w/diff, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, iron studies (TIBC, ferritin)
    -	Reticulocyte index (RI) > 2%: blood loss vs hemolysis; see below
    -	Hemolysis labs: Bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin
    -	RI < 2%:  hypoproliferative à stratify based on RBC size
    -	Microcytic (<80) vs. Normocytic (80-100) vs. Macrocytic (>100)

## Reticulocyte Index >2%

### Background
-	Etiology: consumption vs. blood loss
    -	Loss: acute bleed vs iatrogenic from labs
    -	Hemolysis: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), intrinsic RBC defects

### Evaluation
-	LDH, ↑ indirect bilirubin, ↓ haptoglobin, PT/PTT
-	Note: haptoglobin can be low in cirrhosis (made by liver), recently transfused blood, large hematoma
-	Peripheral blood smear: evaluated for schistocytes, bite cells, spur cells, spherocytes, etc.
-	Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic anemia

### Extrinsic RBC causes
-	If schistocytes ± thrombocytopenia = MAHA: TTP, other TMA syndromes (HUS, drug-induced, complement-mediated), DIC, HELLP, mechanical valves, malignant HTN, cocaine, scleroderma renal crisis
-	If DAT positive = AIHA 
-	Consider cold agglutinin titer

### Intrinsic RBC causes
-	Sickle cell disease: chronic hemolysis + splenic sequestration crisis where RI is↑ vs aplastic crisis where RI is↓ (see sickle cell section)
-	Hereditary spherocytosis
-	Hereditary elliptocytosis
-	Severe B12 deficiency
-	Spur cell anemia (found in advanced cirrhosis)
-	PNH
-	G6PD: bite cells, Heinz bodies
    -	Usually precipitated by drugs: nitrofurantoin, dapsone, sulfonamides, rasburicase, primaquine

### Management
-	MAHA
    -	DIC: sepsis, malignancy, pregnancy (See “Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation” section)
        -	Treat underlying cause
        -	If active bleeding: FFP, cryoprecipitate (to keep fibrinogen>100), and platelets
    -	TTP: Order ADAMTS13 (prior to plasma transfusion or exchange).
        -	If concern for TTP you should immediately consult Heme and Nephrology
    -	HUS: + shiga toxin, AKI, diarrhea
    -	IVF, antibiotics only to treat extra-renal disease, transfusion as necessary
-	AIHA:
    -	Cold (rare): IgM binds at temp <37
        -	Caused by lymphoproliferative disorder (Waldenstrom’s), mycoplasma, EBV, HIV
        -	Consult Heme. Treat underlying condition. Consider rituximab (steroids ineffective)
    -	Warm: IgG
        -	Idiopathic or associated with lymphoma, SLE, drugs, babesiosis, HIV
        -	Can use steroids, IVIG, rituximab

## RBC Size Framework

### Normocytic anemia: MCV 80-100
-	Etiologies:
    -	Anemia of inflammation (formerly chronic disease): (may also be microcytic)
    -	Anemia of CKD: low Erythropoietin (EPO) levels
    -	Endocrine disease (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency): ↓metabolic demand/O2 requirement
    -	Mixed macrocytic/microcytic disease may have a normal MCV: look for ↑RDW
    -	Pure red cell aplasia: associated with destructive Ab (CLL, thymoma, parvovirus, autoimmune)
    -	Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
    -	Splenic sequestration
    -	Bone marrow failure or infiltration (typically will see pancytopenia)
    -	Vitamin C deficiency, copper deficiency 
-	Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if no identifiable cause or anemia is associated with other cytopenia’s

### Microcytic anemia: MCV <80
