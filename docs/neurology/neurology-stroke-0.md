# Stroke

## Background

- Preferred term: Stroke (CVA is like saying heart attack instead of STEMI) 
- Sudden onset, focal (usually one-sided) neurologic deficits: weakness, sensory loss, vision loss, ataxia/unsteadiness, vertigo, double vision, facial droop, dysarthria, aphasia

- Differential:
    - stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

    - seizure or post-ictal paralysis

    - headache phenomena (complex migraine)

    - cervical spinal cord lesions, though these more commonly cause bilateral symptoms

- Stroke-like symptoms can also develop as recrudescence â€“ previous stroke or brain lesion symptoms worsening with systemic toxic/metabolic/infectious processes or hypotension

## Evaluation

-Critical decision-making information: last known normal (LKN), time symptoms first observed, anticoagulation status, recent surgeries, history of bleeding (severe GIB or ICH), recent medications, platelet count, and baseline neuro exam

- If symptoms developed with LKN within 24 hours -> stroke alert! Purpose of Stroke Alert is to work pt up for acute treatment (thrombolytics and thrombectomy).

    - VUMC: call 11111 and tell the operator stroke alert and current patient location

    - NAVA: Dial 911 from a VA landline and tell them you want to call a Stroke Alert. Use
Stroke Orderset and order a CTH/CTA H/N. Consult and STAT page Neurology residents at 835-5137. Call National Tele-Stroke Provider (469-627-4790), who will run the alert with Neurology residents assisting if possible.

- If < 24 hours, can request Neuro Alert instead. Look for Neuro Alert under Orders in Epic. Neurology will determine if it should be escalated to a Stroke Alert.

- STAT CT Head/CTA/CTP for consideration of TNK or endovascular therapy
    - If renal function is abnormal, discuss with neurology
    -  MRI/MRA is an option but takes longer (MRAs are also better with Gadolinium)
    - Neurology service should be leading this portion

## Management

- Blood pressure goals
    - Ischemic stroke:

        - In general, aim for SBP 110-220, avoiding anti-hypertensives and hypotension

        - Patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may require higher BP to maintain perfusion

    - Hemorrhagic stroke:

        - In general, SBP 130-150 but no need to press if running less

        - These pts are managed in Neuro ICU

        - Reverse coagulopathies and keep platelets >100,000
     
    - Q1H neuro checks
    
    - EKG/telemetry
    
    - TTE with Contrast to assess for intracardiac thrombus/PFO

    - A1c with goal <7.0%

    - LDL with goal <70
