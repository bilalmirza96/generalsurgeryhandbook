# Inpatient Headache (HA)

Lauren Waskowicz

## Background

- Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache

- “Red flags” for secondary headaches (SNOOPPP): systemic symptoms, Neurologic symptoms,
Onset that is sudden (thunderclap), Older age (new headache >40), Progression or evolution in
previous headaches, Postural component, Pregnancy

- Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening pt from sleep, no headache-free
intervals, thunderclap headache (maximal intensity develops within 11 minutes or less)

## Evaluation

- Get a good description of where the pain is, when it started, associated symptoms, and assess
for “red flag” features listed above

- If there are any red flag features, imaging and workup are necessary

- Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is appropriate to evaluate for
aneurysm, dissection or vasospasm (including neck to consider dissection). If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP

- If no red flag features are present, then workup is not necessary, and focus is on treatment

## Management

- NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use (>2-3x/week) runs the risk
of rebound headaches

- Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD, uncontrolled hypertension,
and previous stroke. They must be used within 6 hour of onset
    - There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with SSRI/SNRIs

- Migraines:
    - “Migraine cocktail”: 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg)
    - 2nd line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, Decadron 10mg IV , +/- Toradol 30mg IV, Flexeril 10mg PO
- Cluster headache
    - Triptans, high flow O2 (>10 L), can consider intranasal Lidocaine if no arrhythmia history
