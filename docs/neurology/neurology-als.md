# Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Nicholas Mallett

## Background

- Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound with no sensory
    loss

- Combination of LMN and UMN findings

    - LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, absent/decreased reflexes,
        fasciculations

    - UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic
        reflexes
      
- Bulbar symptoms: dysphagia, increased saliva production (they are not swallowing it),
changes in voice

- Tongue fasciculations are best assessed while tongue rests in mouth and observed for ~30
seconds but can be hard to be certain of (symmetric movements are typically not fasciculations). A light can be helpful, and atrophy if present, can help differentiate from normal movements

- Pseudobulbar affect (inappropriate laughing or crying) is relatively common in ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders.

- FVC is an important respiratory marker for function.

## Evaluation

- EMG/NCV is gold standard using the El Escorial or Awaji Criteria for diagnosis

- Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below)

## Management

- Pts with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team of neurologists, pulmonologists,
PT, OT, and SLP

- Given the extensive, specialized care requirements, the Office of Outpt Referral Assistance can
assist in getting uninsured pt established with specialists

- Three medications have been shown to add a few months to survival:
    - Riluzole: PO, requires CBC/LFT monitoring, AE: GI distress and general weakness
    - Edaravone: IV, QD x2weeks every month, AE: headache, bruising
    - Sodium Phenylbutyrate: PO, recently approved by FDA (9/2022), shown to delay
ventilator-dependence by ~7 months, AE: GI distress

- Otherwise, symptomatic management

## Mimics of ALS

- Primary lateral sclerosis: UMN-only disease, less common than ALS with slower progression.
Suspected to be on spectrum with ALS.

- Cervical spine lesions: UMN changes in UE with LMN pattern in LE. MRI can reveal lesion

- Multifocal motor neuropathy: rare autoimmune disorder with LMN-only signs. Responds to
IVIG. Can be anti-GM1 Ab positive. EMG/NCV distinguishes from ALS.

- Kennedy Disease: X-linked genetic disorder with progressive LMN pattern, endocrine
disorders, and androgen-resistance symptoms (gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis)

- Inclusion body myositis: Can be asymmetric with grip weakness and quadriceps weakness.
Biopsy and atrophy pattern usually distinguishes it. CPK typically runs 500-800.

- Polymyositis/dermatomyositis: proximal weakness in BUE/BLE, CPK typically runs >1000,
usually younger onset (30-40s), no UMN signs.
