# Vertigo

## Background

- Sensation of the room (or themselves) spinning or moving
  
- Must distinguish from lightheadedness, presyncope, orthostasis, and disequilibrium (unsteady
on feet) via history

- Distinguishing between central vs peripheral pattern is useful for workup and management

- Central pattern: typically less sudden onset (unless stroke), continuous symptoms
independent of position, no/limited hearing loss, and may have other FND

- Peripheral pattern: typically sudden onset, positional with severe nausea, tinnitus, or
decreased hearing, no other FND

- Causes best differentiated based on chronicity and triggers rather than description of
symptoms

## Etiologies:

- BPPV: loose otoliths; short duration (<1min), very positional, nystagmus is horizontal and
torsional, towards affected ear with posterior canal being most commonly involved; treat with
particle repositioning maneuvers

- Vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis: typically follows URI or ear infection with unidirectional
nystagmus away from affected ear; self-limited, but if severe/prolonged can treat with
steroids

- Meniere’s disease: Vertigo, tinnitus, and low range frequency hearing loss. Gradually
progressive. Treated with diuretics, salt restriction, Meclizine, and sometimes surgery or
intratympanic injections

- Endolymphatic leak: Usually following trauma or concussive blasts. Requires ENT evaluation
and management. Classically a loud sound will cause vertigo and nystagmus

- Vertiginous migraine: episodic vertigo associated with headaches; usual migraine triggers,
may have aura; often positive family history of migraine

- Stroke: Typically due to brainstem or cerebellar infarct; sudden onset; rare cause of isolated vertigo; ask about vascular RF. Also consider vertebral dissection or vertebrobasilar TIA

- Drug-induced: assess recent changes in medications; includes codeine, aminoglycosides,
macrolides, sulfamethoxazole, NSAIDs, prednisone, anti-malarials, diuretics, beta-blockers,
alpha-antagonists, lithium, antipsychotics

- Other causes: demyelinating disease (MS), epileptic vertigo (focal seizures), Ramsay-Hunt
syndrome (Herpes zoster oticus), cerebellopontine angle tumors (often little vertigo as CNS
compensates as tumor slowly grows)

## Evaluation and Management

- Careful exam of vertigo will be more helpful than random scans, but pt has to be symptomatic for exam to mean anything
    - HINTS Battery – Head Impulse test, Nystagmus pattern, Test of Skew
      - Only useful if pt is currently symptomatic
      - Central pattern: no corrective saccade, multidirectional nystagmus, skew present
      - Peripheral pattern: corrective saccade, unidirectional nystagmus, no skew present
    - Dix-Hallpike Test
    - Cerebellar testing: Finger nose finger (FNF), heel knee shin (HKS), mirroring, gait o
    - Outpt Vestibular function testing with ENT

- Central patterns will need head and vessel imaging looking for vertebral dissection or basilar clots
    - Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications

- Peripheral causes are varied and often require evaluation by ENT as an outpt

- Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is often helpful; antiemetics if significant nausea; and benzodiazepines for refractory acute attacks

- Vestibular therapy is also very beneficial
