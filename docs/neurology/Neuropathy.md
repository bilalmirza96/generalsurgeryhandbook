#Neuropathy

Nicholas Mallett

## Background

- Peripheral neuropathy is damage to peripheral nerves. Classical polyneuropathy is slow,
chronic, progressive sensory loss in length-dependent fashion

- Common etiologies of polyneuropathy: Diabetes, chronic EtOH use, Vitamin
Deficiencies/Toxicities, chronic HIV/HBV/HCV, Amyloidosis, Monoclonal Gammopathies,
Hypothyroidism, autoimmune, Medication, and Critical Illness

- Mononeuropathy: sensory +/- motor symptoms in single peripheral nerve distribution (ie
carpel tunnel). Can be from local trauma, compression, entrapment

- Radiculopathy is from spine nerve root localization (ie L4), polyradiculopathy if multiple,
plexopathy is process affecting multiple nerves in brachial or lumbosacral plexus

- Large Fiber Neuropathy: loss of vibration sense/proprioception

- Small Fiber Neuropathy: loss of pain/temperature sensation – cannot be dx by EMG/NCS!

## Evaluation

- Usually diagnosed clinically based on examination and history

- Polyneuropathy presents with slow, progressive sensory loss in the classic “stocking and
glove” distribution, usually beginning in the lower extremities.

- Many patients don’t realize numbness until very symptomatic (can’t feel car pedals, burning
pain, gait disturbances, etc). Can have +Romberg, falls in dark due to poor proprioception

- Reduced reflexes on examination

- In cases where exam is not sufficient, EMG/NCS can aid in diagnosis

- Important to determine etiology behind neuropathy to attempt to stop/slow progression

- Basic lab work: A1c, B12 (<400 can cause symptoms), SPEP+IFE

## Management

- No treatment to reverse numbness, aim to treat pain if needed

- Address underlying etiology to prevent progression

- If rapidly progressive, consider referral to Neurology for evaluation

- Neuropathic pain management
  - Gabapentin/Pregabalin – PROS: antiseizure benefits, headache treatment; CONS: dizziness, drowsiness  -
  - Duloxetine – PROS: anxiety/depression effect, migraine prophylaxis; CONS: risk of Serotonin Syndrome/Mania
  - Amitriptyline – PROS: depression treatment, headache prophylaxis; CONS: anticholinergic effects
  - Alpha Lipoic Acid – relatively benign OTC supplement with antioxidant properties shown to reduce nerve hypoxia with diabetic neuropathy
  - Topicals: Lidocaine, Capsaicin
  - DO NOT PRESCRIBE OPIOIDS FOR NEUROPATHIC PAIN AS THEY HAVE LITTLE
BENEFIT
