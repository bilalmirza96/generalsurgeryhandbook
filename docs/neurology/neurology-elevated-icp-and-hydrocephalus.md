# Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Hydrocephalus

Madelaine Behrens

## Background

- Communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. non-obstructive)

    - Causes: subarachnoid granule scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis (Cryptococcal), ependymoma producing excess CSF, venous sinus thrombosis
    - Safe to perform lumbar puncture

- Non-communicating/Obstructive Hydrocephalus
    - Causes: tumor, abscess, or hematoma in the midline ventricular structures
    - Avoid lumbar punctures due to risk of herniation

- Eventually, elevated ICP will cause brain herniation

## Presentation

- Headache (can be positional), blurred vision, visual field reduction, enlarged blind spot,
nausea, vomiting, encephalopathy, syncope, coma

- Sixth nerve palsies are common (inability for eye to look towards ipsilateral side)

- Third nerve palsies (blown pupil) are classically associated with uncal herniation

## Evaluation
- Visual exam: visual fields, enlarged blind spot, papilledema (may not be present if very rapid ICP increase, even with vision loss), and CN6 nerve palsies

- STAT head CT to look for midline shift, obstructions, and mass lesions
    - Consider Neurosurgery evaluation if obstructive lesion or concern for herniation (craniectomy vs resection vs evacuation vs ventricular drain)

- CTV or MRV w/wo to look for venous sinus thrombosis (especially in pregnant pts) o Venous sinus thrombosis needs anticoagulation, even if there is some degree of
hemorrhagic infarction

- If no obstructive lesion, obtain lumbar puncture with opening pressure (elevated OP >
20mmgHg)
    - If workup is otherwise normal, except for elevated opening pressure, this is suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension

## Management

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
    - Acetazolamide and/or topiramate
    - Ophthalmology evaluation emergently for consideration of nerve sheath fenestrations or
urgent ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement if severe disc edema

- If there is clinical concern for herniation
    - Cushing Triad: vital sign changes in herniation, widened pulse pressure (increasing systolic, decreasing diastolic), bradycardia, and irregular respirations
    - Mannitol: 50g IV, can be given peripherally. Has risks of renal injury. Associated with initial increase in ICP, often given with furosemide to counter this.
    - Hypertonic saline: 3%, 7% or 23% saline can be given, needs central access for repeat administration but initial dose can be given via peripheral IV
    - Maintain head of bed at least 30Â° and loosen neck obstructions (c-collars) as able
    - Consider neurosurgery consult for shunt/external ventricular drain consideration
    - Hyperventilation can be done with goal PaCO2 30-34 mmHg or ETCO2 20-30 mmHg but is
only a temporizing measure and risks rebound edema
        - After 4-6h, compensatory pH changes in the blood prevent vasoconstrictive affects
