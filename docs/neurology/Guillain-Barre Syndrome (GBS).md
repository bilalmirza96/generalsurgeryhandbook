Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS)

## Background

- Rapid-onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending weakness and
numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial musculature

- Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior (Campylobacter, CMV, Flu, HIV, etc)

- Pts are much more likely to get GBS from an infection than any vaccine, weak vaccine links to
GBS are an additional 1-2 cases per million flu vaccines

## Presentation

- Most common form is acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP)

- Progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and potentially subjective sensatory
changes, especially back pain, with nadir being reached within 4 weeks

- Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too

- There are many variants of GBS

- Miller-Fischer Syndrome: ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, areflexia

- Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis: encephalopathy, ophthalmoplegia, ataxia

- Pure Sensory GBS: sensory loss with only mild motor involvement

- Do not use lack of classic ascending weakness to dismiss the idea of GBS

## Evaluation

- LP: albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell count
  - One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell count and high protein count

- EMG/NCV: usually normal early in course, so typically performed at least 2 weeks after symptom onset

- MRI L-Spine w/wo: Assess for spinal cord lesions, can demonstrate nerve root enhancement

- Ddx: Spinal cord lesions, LEMS, MG, acute HIV or HCV, viral myelitis (enterovirus/WNV)

## Management

- ABCs! Then ensure adequate respiratory status with baseline NIF/VC, then Q4-6H

- NIF > -30 with good effort, generally warrants ICU monitoring

- IVIG or PLEX

- Avoid steroids as they can worsen symptoms
