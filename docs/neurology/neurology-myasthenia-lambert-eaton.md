# Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

## Background

- Disorders of the neuromuscular junction
  
- MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor (fatigability worsens with use)

- LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels (fatigability improves with use)     - Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung carcinoma)

## Presentation

- Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia

- Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger, usually also with dysphagia

- Initially, the pt may not look sick or distressed, but may have a short inspiratory time or
difficulty speaking in complete sentences due to shallow breathing

- Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present initially with crisis

## Evaluation

- Physical exam
    - Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra breaths, holding upward gaze
    - These pts do not exhibit “huffing and puffing” like in COPD/asthma exacerbations
          - Pts with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated within several hours!
    - LEMS: less ocular weakness but does have extremity weakness and absent reflexes that improve with muscle use (facilitation)
    - Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS
- EMG/NCS
    - MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation
    - LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation

- Labs: myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given)

- Imaging: consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia

## Management
- Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and Q4H-Q8H
    - Measure of diaphragmatic strength (more negative = more force)
    - Normal is more negative than -60
    - If more positive than -30, consider elective intubation
    - Note that pt effort will affect NIF values

- IVIG or PLEX
    - Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do
    - PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid shifts) and coagulopathy
    -  IVIG -> check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of aseptic meningitis and
provides significant fluid load so not ideal for pts with CHF

- Steroids
    - Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20mg Prednisone daily)
    - Rapid increases in steroids can worsen pts with MG, so talk to Neurology before adjusting

- Pyridostigmine
    - Typically continue at their home dose
    - Too much pyridostigmine can make pts worse (more secretions), so for those doing poorly
on >90mg per dose, consider lowering the dose

- Treat underlying causes of exacerbations—usually infections or other toxic/metabolic insults

- Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: Fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides, beta blockers,
Mg. There are many medications to avoid. Please refer to UpToDate for more thorough list.

- LEMS specific management:
    - 3,4-Diaminopyridine
    - Can respond to IVIG or Pyridostigmine
    - Workup for underlying neoplasm
