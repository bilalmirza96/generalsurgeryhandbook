# Altered Mental Status (AMS)

Aisha Suara

## Background

- Definition: change in a pt’s baseline cognition. Medical diagnosis is encephalopathy
    - Can be hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive (agitated)

- Risk factors: Functional impairment (hard of hearing, visually impaired, bed-bound), age > 75,
dementia/neurodegenerative diseases, prior brain injury (stroke, TBI), depression, ETOH/substance use disorder, sensory impairment, recent surgery

## Etiologies: Consider MOVE STUPID mnemonic

- Metabolic (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia)
  
- Oxygen (Hypoxia)

- Vascular (CVA, Bleed, MI, CHF)

- Endocrine (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid, Adrenal)

- Seizure (postictal state)

- Trauma

- Uremia

- Psychiatric

- Infection

- Drugs – intoxication, withdrawal, or medications

- Delirium – see “Delirium” section in psychiatry

## Evaluation

- Consider broad toxic, metabolic, and infectious workup as appropriate
    - TSH, Vit B1 (whole blood), Vitamin B12, CBC, CMP, BCx, UA with rfx UCx, CXR, VBG, Glucose, UDS, +/- RPR

- Review medications
    - Beer’s Criteria, sedatives, anticholinergics, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal

- Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings: if acute focal deficits, consider activating stroke alert
    - Start with CT Head – ischemic strokes take up to 24 hours to show up on CT
    - Consider MRI if high concern for stroke, inflammatory changes or infection

- LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis

- EEG is reasonable with fluctuating mental status or seizure-like activity

## Management

- Management of underlying etiology

- Consider empiric thiamine supplementation

- See "Delirium" in section in psychiatry for nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic management
