# Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis

## Background 

- Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is often defined as serum Na < 135 mmol/L
  
- Very common problem; prevalence: ~50% of individuals have serum < 135 mmol/L, ~22% <
130 mmol/L

- Degree of hyponatremia is associated with progression of cirrhosis; patients with hypona have greater incidence of HE, SBP, and HRS, increased complications & mortality pre/post-tx.
  
- Patients most commonly have hypervolemic (dilutional) hypona.
  
- Pathophysiology
    - Hypovolemic hyponatremia: 2/2 excessive diuretic use
    - Hypervolemic hyponatremia: Advanced cirrhosis -> chronic inflammation and fibrosis in liver -> increased resistance to portal flow -> portal hypertension -> release of vasoactive compounds (primarily nitric oxide) -> splanchnic arterial vasodilation -> reduced effective
 
## Evaluation 

- Uosm, Sosm, UNa to rule out competing processes (e.g. beer potomania)

## Management 

- Do not correct Na faster than 6-8mEq/L in 24 hours
  
- Discontinue anti-hypertensives (including beta blockers) in patients with ascites and hypona.

- Hold diuretics when Na <125
  
- Fluid restriction is recommended only in patients with Na <125. Restriction is generally
effective at 1-1.5L and must be less than daily UOP to increase free water excretion

- Replete K to 4.0
  
- 25% albumin infusion (1g/kg split into BID dosing), has been shown to increase serum Na and have higher rates of hypona resolution at 30 days
  
- Treatment considerations include vasopressors, urea tabs
  
- Vaptans are generally not used in clinical practice given recent RCTs showing harm with use
  
- Salt tabs should not be used to raise serum Na due to worsening hypervolemia
  
- Nephrology should be consulted if not improved after 48 hours
