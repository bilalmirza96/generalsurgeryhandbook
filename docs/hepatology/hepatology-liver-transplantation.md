# Liver Transplant (LT) Workup

Katelyn Backhaus

## Background

- Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score: initially developed to predict survival following TIPS placement, though is now used to objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver transplant (LT)
    - Factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, and Na.
    - Exception points given for complications like HCC and hepatopulmonary            syndrome (HPS), leading to score in mid to high 20’s even if biologic MELD       is low
    - Highest score lasts for 7 days
-   Listing a patient for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
    committee

    -   Acute Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated                 cirrhosis pts for LT

## Evaluation 

-   Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to evaluate        for hepatic malignancy and vascular anatomy

-   Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and Hepatitis A, B,      and C

-   Cardiac evaluation: If RVSP > 40mmHg on TTE, then R Heart Catheterization is     indicated

-   PFT’s, carotid ultrasound

-   Panorex to identify dental disease; consult OMFS pending results
  
-   Appropriate cancer screenings (CXR in all patients, CT Chest in                  prior/current smokers, colonoscopy, pap smear, mammogram, and PSA if             applicable)

-   DEXA scan (osteoporosis in up to 55% of individuals with cirrhosis)

-   Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP)
    for substance abuse

-   Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross
    sectional imaging

-   Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)

-   Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent from alcohol for no less than 3     -6 months,although exceptions may be made for early liver transplant based       on a very strict protocol. Discuss exception criteria with attending if          suspect patient unlikely to survive hospitalization without transplant

-   Both living and deceased donor transplant are offered at VUMC. Donor evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential recipient is deemed a candidate. Of note, should consider possible simultaneous liver-kidney transplantation for 1) CKD <30mL/min after > 90 days of eGFR<60 or 2) AKI dependent on dialysis >8 weeks or if extensive glomerulosclerosis present.
