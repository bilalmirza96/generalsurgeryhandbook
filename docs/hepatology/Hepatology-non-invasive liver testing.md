## Evaluation
- Who should be evaluated: patients with steatosis noted on imaging or for whom there is a
clinical suspicion of MASLD, such as those with metabolic risk factors (e.g., HTN, HLD,
T2DM, obesity) or unexplained elevations in liver chemistries

- Primary risk assessment for MASLD -> FIB-4 – estimates degree of scarring and is based on
age, AST, ALT, platelet count; high negative predictive value to exclude advanced fibrosis (F3- 4); less reliable in patients under the age of 35 or over the age of 65
  - If FIB-4 <1.3 -> reassess periodically
    - Every 1-2 years if T2DM/pre-T2DM or ≥2 metabolic risk factors
    - Every 2-3 years if no T2DM and <2 metabolic risk factors
  - If FIB-4 ≥ 1.3 -> secondary risk assessment with elastography Vibration-controlled
transient elastography (VCTE) also known as FibroScan if BMI < 35 or MR elastography if BMI > 35)
    - Low risk = VCTE <8 kilopascal, MRE without significant fibrosis (F2-4), reassess
periodically
    - Intermediate/high risk = VCTE >8, MRE F2-4 -> referral to Hepatology
  - If FIB-4 > 2.67 -> immediate referral to Hepatology
    
- Secondary risk assessment for MASLD -> (VCTE), also known as FibroScan, which provides
following measurements:
  - CAP score (dB/m) -> rough estimate of steatosis with relatively limited reliability
    - 238 – 260 -> S1 (less 1/3 of liver affected by fatty change)
    - 260 – 290 -> S2 (between 1/3 and 2/3 of liver affected by fatty change)
    - 290 – 400 -> S3 (mor than 2/3 of liver affected by fatty change)
  - Liver stiffness (LSM) (kPa) -> fibrosis score ... ranges differ based on underlying liver disease but approximately,
    - 2 – 7 -> F0 to F1
    - 8 – 11 -> F2
    - 11 – 14 -> F3
    - 14 or higher -> F4
  - Limitations to VCTE: not available at all centers, significant central adiposity that interferes
with measurements, cardiac device not amenable to use of VCTE

- AGILE 3+ – a recently developed score based on combination of AST/ALT ratio, platelet
count, diabetes, sex, age, LSM
- Shear wave elastography interpretation:
  - ≤ 5 kPa -> high probability of being normal
  - < 9 kPa -> In the abscence of other known clinical signs, rule out compensated advanced
liver disease (cACLD). If there are known clinical signs, may need further test for
confirmation
  - 9-13 kPa suggestive of cACLD but need further test for confirmation o > 13 kPa Rules in cACLD
  - > 17 kPa suggestive of clinically significant portal hypertension
