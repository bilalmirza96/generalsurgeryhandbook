# Ascites 

## Background

- Associated with a reduction in 5 year survival from 80% to 30%.

- Most often due to portal HTN. Less common causes include peritoneal or metastatic cancer,
CHF, TB, nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and pancreatitis

| Grade 3 Ascites | Marked, tense abdominal distension       | LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) |

## Evaluation

- Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites

- Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly to rule out occult SBP
    - Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain: Total Protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture
    - Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture, protein
    - Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside (VA does not allow bedside innoculation)

- See Procedure section for guidance on paracentesis. 

- Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) = serum albumin - ascites albumin.

# Hepatic Hydrothorax

## Background

- Transudative effusion, typically unilateral (75% right sided); reflects ascitic fluid that passes through defects in the diaphragm. 10% can develop without clinical ascites.

- Present in 4-12% of cirrhotics and portends a poor prognosis (75% mortality within 90 days)

## Evaluation

- Often suspected clinically, though must exclude pleural/cardiopulmonary process

- Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests: cell count, protein, albumin, LDH, culture
    - Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, hematocrit, cytology

- Rule out SBE which is diagnosed the same as SBP (PMN>250)

## Management

- Similar management of ascites as noted above

- AVOID chest-tube placement. associated with increased morbidity and mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein as well as increased infection risk
    - PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice patients)
    
- Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. 

- Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP (see below)
