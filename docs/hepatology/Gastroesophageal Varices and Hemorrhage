## Background

- Varices form due to portosystemic collaterals in the setting of portal HTN

- Gastroesophageal varices are present in approximately 50% of patients with cirrhosis and their
presence correlates with severity of liver disease

- The risk of mortality with esophageal variceal hemorrhage (EVH) can be up to 15-20%

- Recurrence occurs in over 60% of patients within 1-2 years of the index event

- The most important predictor of hemorrhage is the size of the varices. Other predictors
include decompensated cirrhosis (Child B/C) and endoscopic presence of red wale marks or red spots

- Variceal Screening:
    - Regular screening not required in all patients with cirrhosis though initial EGD at time of
cirrhosis diagnosis is recommended. Screening can be omitted in patients without evidence of clinically significant portal hypertension (low liver stiffness on elastography [LSM <20 and platelets >150], repeated TE annually) and in patients at low risk of bleed on NSBB.
    - Compensated cirrhosis without varices: EGD q3yr
    - Compensated cirrhosis with small varices that have not bled: EGD q2yr (unless on NSBB,
then no need for follow-up EGD)
    - Decompensated cirrhosis: EGD at time of decompensated and then q1yr
    - Medium/large varices that have not bled: NSBB if tolerated (follow up surveillance EGD
unnecessary) or EVL, repeated until obliterated with first surveillance EGD 1-3 months
after and q 6-12 months to check for recurrence

- In general, most patients with cirrhosis should be on propranolol or carvedilol (preferred due
to intrinsic anti-alpha-1-adrenergic activity and facilitates the release of nitric oxide, induces intrahepatic vasodilation further reducing portal pressure), per new guidelines. Always check with the hep attendings if BB needs to be started.

##Management (Non-Bleeding Varices)
- Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred if tolerated; see table below) or endoscopic variceal
ligation (EVL). EVL indicated in patients with high risk of bleeding (medium/large varices, small varices with red wale sign, or decompensated patients with varices of any size).
    - Carvedilol has greater reduction in portal pressures and is preferred if tolerated (goal
6.25mg BID)
    - Nadolol (given nightly as portal pressures are highest at night) or propranolol (BID) 
    - For secondary ppx, initiate ~72hr after acute bleed has resolved and octreotide discontinued

- Discontinue if: hypotension (SBP <90), AKI-HRS, SBP, or hyponatremia with refractory ascites

- Secondary ppx with both NSBB and EVL
    - NSBB are associated with reduced mortality, while EVL is not

- Of note, in patients with clinically significant portal HTN but are without varices, there is no
evidence to support the use of NSBB to prevent varices formation, but high-level evidence does support use of NSBB (strongest evidence for Carvedilol) in prevention of any decompensation (ascites, variceal hemorrhage, HE) and has a mortality benefit (likely driven by significant reduction in ascites development)

##Management (Bleeding Varices)

- Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate with blood products and albumin.
Activate massive transfusion protocol if needed.

- Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental status, ongoing hematemesis,
or inability to protect airway

- Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of 50 mcg/h, to be continued
for at 2-5 days should EVH be confirmed on endoscopy

- Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then transition to PO
ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course

- Consult GI for upper endoscopy for possible EVL vs sclerotherapy. EGD should be performed
within 12 hours of admission.

- Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure before definitive
management. Patient must be intubated before placement, and preferably GI should be made
aware prior to placement.

- No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding as excessive blood products
and FFP can increase portal pressures and cause worsening bleeding
    - Vitamin K can be given w/ â†‘ INR, though is unlikely to help in the acute setting 
    - Check TEG and fibrinogen and transfuse based on results
    - AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during variceal hemorrhage

- Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy
