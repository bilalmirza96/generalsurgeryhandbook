### Pacemakers:
   - Provide anti-bradycardia pacing by stimulating myocardium
   - Peripheral permanent pacemakers (PPMs)
       - SubQ generator, transvenous leads
           - Single chamber RV or RA lead
           - Dual chamber RV and RA leads (most common)
           - BiV (CRT- cardiac resynchronization therapy): RV, RA, and LV (coronary sinus) leads
   
   - Leadless pacemaker (Micra)
       - Implanted generator in RV
   
   - Indications
       - Symptomatic sinus node dysfunction: sinoatrial exit block, sinus pause, sinus bradycardia, tachy-brady syndrome
       - Degenerative AV block: 2nd degree type II (Mobitz II) or 3rd degree
       - Neurocardiogenic syncope

### Implantable Cardioverter/Defibrillators (ICDs)

   - Types:
   - Transvenous: defibrillation coil +/- pacing lead
       - Detect and treat VT/VF
       - Anti-tachycardic pacing (ATP)- attempts to pace out of VT to prevent a shock
       - Defibrillation if ATP unsuccessful
   
   - Subcutaneous: defibrillation only, all extravascular
   - Indications:
       - Primary prevention
           - HFrEF
             - EF \<35% and NYHA II-III or EF \<30% and NYHA I
             - Must be \>90d from revasc, \>40d from MI, and on GDMT \>90d if
            non-ischemic
           - Arrhythmogenic syndromes
             - Arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy, Brugada syndrome, HCM and cardiac sarcoid with specific risk factors
       - Secondary prevention
           - Sudden cardiac death
           - Sustained VT/VF
           - Inducible VT on EP study with history of syncope

### Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy (CRT)
   - BiV pacer that coordinates LV/RV contraction through synchronized activation of each ventricle following atrial contraction.
   - -P: CRT pacing only
   - -D: ICD function
   - Class I indications: LBBB and QRSâ‰¥150 with EF90d, NSR

### Loop Recorders
- implantable devices for monitoring arrhythmias (most often Afib)

### LVADs
- augment cardiac output for end-stage heart failure

### Interpreting Pacemaker Codes

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| A: atrial, V: ventricular, D: dual, O: none, I: inhibition, R: rate-adaptive | Chamber Paced | Chamber Sensed | Response to Sensed Beat | Program Features |

### Examples of Common Pacing Modes

- VVI: Single RV lead that delivers a beat if no beat sensed. Often
    used with chronic AF with bradycardia
- DDDR: Senses and paces both the atria and ventricle. If beat not
    sensed within a predefined interval, beat delivered. R indicates
    rate responsivity (changes rate based on changes in patient
    activity)
- Magnet: Paces at a fixed rate without respect to native electrical
    activity (AOO,VOO,DOO). Deactivates ICD shock. Often used in surgery
    or at end of life to avoid ICD shocks

### Peri-Procedural Anticoagulation:

-   NOAC: hold 24-72h before procedure and 24-72h following procedure
-   Warfarin: continue through procedure
-   Antiplatelet: continue through procedure
-   Heparin and heparin related products to be avoided peri-implantation
    due to higher rates of pocket hematoma
    
### Placement Complications

-   Pocket hematoma - Cardiac Tamponade
-   Pneumothorax - Infection
-   Myocardial Perforation - Lead Displacement or Disconnection

### Long term Complications

-   Secondary device Infection
-   Lead fracture (lead lifetime 10-15 years)
-   Insulation failure

    The Pacemaker ID app is free and is useful for identifying device
    brand for interrogation

    When differentiating PPM vs. ICD, look for a coil and charge
    generator to identify the ICD.
