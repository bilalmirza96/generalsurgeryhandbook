# Lung Masses 

Sybil Watkins, Chandler Montgomery

Background

- Definitions: lesion < 3 cm = pulmonary nodule. Lesion > 3 cm = lung mass
    - Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung mass (>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high (>50%)
    - Refer to “Pulmonary Nodule” chapter

- Differential diagnosis:
    - Malignant
        - Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC): adenocarcinoma (~40%), squamous cell (SCC, ~20%), large cell carcinoma (~5%)
        - Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal, testicular
        - Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g. cannonball)
        - Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC, ~15%), carcinoid, large cell
neuroendocrine
    - Infectious
        - Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo, blasto, coccidio)
        - May have component of calcification
        - Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial (aspiration)
        - Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma
    - Other: hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA, RA), sarcoidosis

## Evaluation
- History: smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight loss, fevers, night sweats,hoarseness (recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement), bone pain, FND, Horner’s syndrome
    - Lung cancer should always be considered in a pt with recurrent pneumonia (post-obstructive) or smoking history with new cough or hemoptysis

- Exam: cachexia, LAD, bone pain, hepatomegaly, FND, SVC syndrome, digital clubbing

- Imaging
    - CXR has poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or malignant effusion
    - CT chest (with contrast if possible—better evaluation of mediastinum/LNs)
        - Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of lesion(s)
        - Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules
        - Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion
        - Location: adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion, and large hilar masses

- Look for paraneoplastic syndromes
    - SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing’s syndrome
    - SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP)
    - Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (periostitis of long bones)
    - Maranticendocarditis
    - Hypercoagulabilityleadingtovenousthromboembolism

## Staging/Diagnosis
- Imaging: CT chest (with contrast if possible) and CTAP w/contrast vs. PET/CT to assess for metastasis. Consider MRI brain if clinical stage III or IV disease
- Biopsy: careful planning is key
    - For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site
        - FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology dept, US-guided procedure, EGS)
        - Pleural effusion: thoracentesis w/ cytology might provide initial info (sensitivity ~60%)
    - If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach
        - Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic resection in good surgical candidate
        - Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion
        - Navigational bronchoscopy: allows for more precise maneuvering of scope/instrument into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while ensuring stability during sampling of target lesions; increased diagnostic yield
        - Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not amenable to bronchoscopy

## Management
- NSCLC: Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor board
    - Stage I/II: surgical resection ± adjuvant chemotherapy
    - Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach, typically combined chemoradiotherapy specifically with immunotherapy agents
    - Stage IV: chemo ± targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression, presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET, others

- SCLC: usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis (~70%), treated with systemic chemo/radiation specifically with immunotherapy agents
