# Acute Asthma Exacerbation

## Presentation

- Sub-acute to acute progressive worsening of dyspnea, chest tightness, wheezing, and cough

- Important historical cues: Prior hx of asthma, adherence to controller medications, triggers
(exercise, allergens, cold)

- Risk stratifying: Hx of intubations/ exacerbations, recent steroid course for exacerbation

- Physical exam: wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, ↑ work of breathing, hypoxemia

- Peak flows can help and are often cited in literature but do not change management acutely,
can be useful as baseline for assessing response to therapy.

- PEF <200 L/min or PEF <50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF <70% predicted
indicates moderate exacerbation)

## Evaluation

- Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other
    diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts
    being admitted for inpatient management:

    - EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE)

    - CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)

    - ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or
        lethargic/altered

- Dangerous signs and possible ICU if:

    - Tachypnea >30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing

    - Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually
        hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could
        indicate impending respiratory failure)

    - Altered mental status

    - Requiring continuous nebulizers

## Management

- Good asthma care requires frequent re-evaluation. Generally, reassess q1h after treatment
initiation. If deteriorating, step up the ladder of management


- ABC: if not protecting airway, intubate and admit to ICU

- Peak expiratory flow (Order in EPIC “Peak Flow Measurement”). If pt cannot do it, consider
A/VBG if ill-appearing, tachypneic, lethargic/AMS, or thinking about engaging ICU

- SpO2 goal 93-95%. Avoid hyperoxia

- Further work-up: Not required, but aimed at ruling out causes of exacerbation and other dx

- CBC w/ diff (looking at eosinophils)

- CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)

- Corticosteroids: dosing based on severity of illness
    - Oral equivalent to IV (Lancet 1986;1:181-184)
    - Transition to PO and lower dose after improving air movement, work of breathing and gas
exchange
    - Will need minimum of 5-7 days of oral corticosteroids.
    - Good data for no need to taper in general population, sometimes considered in someone with multiple severe exacerbations.

- Step down SABA-Nebulizer treatments based on wheezing

- Inspiratory/Expiratory wheezing q2 -> q3; Mostly Expiratory wheezing q3 -> q4; Minimal
Wheezing q4 -> q6 or PRN. (Pediatrics 2000; 106 (5): 1006–12)

- No need for empiric antibiotics unless there is concern for bacterial infection, then treat as Pneumonia (see Pneumonia chapters)

## Prior to discharge:

- Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications (see
    outpatient management)

- See outpt management section but consider starting an ICS/LABA as part of SMART (JAMA
2018; 319(14):1485–1496)

- Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events (noncompliance, resp
viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.). Evaluate for asthma inflammatory phenotype after recovery
(IgE, peripheral eos, ABPA)

- Can consider writing a simple asthma action plan (https://ginasthma.org/wp-

- Consider follow up with PCP vs. pulmonologist for evaluation of outpt regimen
