# Lung Nodules

David Krasinski

## Background
- Definition: focal, distinct radiographic density completely surrounded by lung tissue <3cm
(mass >3cm – see “Lung Mass” chapter)

- Prevalence: 30% of all chest CTs. Most commonly are incidentalomas. >95% are benign. Larger
and irregularly shaped nodules are more likely to be malignant.

## Management of solitary lung nodule
- History: hx of exposures (tobacco, asbestos, mining, biomass fuel), geographical epidemiology
(histo/coccidio/TB), B-symptoms, personal and FxHx of malignancy

- Assess pt risk for malignancy
  - High risk: >60yo, current smoker or heavy smoking history, history of cancer, FxHx lung cancer, irregular or spiculated, upper lobe, ≥2.3cm, double diameter or volume in past year
  - There are online risk calculators (Brock, Mayo, Herder) helpful for providers who are not experts in lung nodule risk stratification

- Benign imaging features: central calcification, popcorn-like (hamartomas), laminated, stippled

- Consider Pulmonary referral if high risk features, known malignancy or recent history of
malignancy, organ transplant or other immunocompromising condition, age <35yo

- Fleischner guidelines for nodules <8mm
