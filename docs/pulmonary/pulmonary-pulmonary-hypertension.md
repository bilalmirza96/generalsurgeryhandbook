# Pulmonary Hypertension 

Pakinam Mekki

## Background

- Symptoms: exertional dyspnea, presyncope, fatigue, exertional chest pain, edema; syncope is a very concerning symptom

- Physical exam: JVD, widely split S2, holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation murmur, pulmonary
diastolic murmur (Graham Steel), hepatomegaly, ascites, edema

- Main chief complaint for admission: volume overload secondary to RV failure and/or hypoxia

- WHO Groups and Causes: 

    - Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): obliteration of
        blood vessels in the lung 

        - Idiopathic, heritable 

        - Drugs/toxins (methamphetamine) 

        - Associated with CTD, HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease,
            schistosomiasis 

        - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary
            hemangiomatosis 

    - Group 2: Left heart disease: back pressure and passive congestion 

        - HFrEF, HFpEF, valvular disease, LA stiffness 

    - Group 3: Chronic lung disease: chronic hypoxemia, chronic pulmonary
        vasoconstriction 

        - COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude, developmental lung
            disorders 

    - Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 

    - Group 5: Multifactorial

        - Hematologic disorders, chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis,
            pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing
            mediastinitis, metabolic disorders 

## Evaluation

- Labs: BNP, CMP, HIV, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/reflex ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/La), blood gas (↑ A-a gradient, ↓ PaO2, ↓ PCO2; rule out hypercapnia from alveolar hypoventilation)

- EKG: right atrial enlargement (peaked P waves), RBBB, RV hypertrophy

- PFT: rule out obstructive and restrictive disease; PAH usually has mild restriction with mild DLCO impairment

- Sleep studies: evaluation for chronic hypoxemia from OSA; if low suspicion for OSA/CSA, can start with overnight oximetry

- 6-min walk test: important for prognostication, baseline exertional capacity, and to evaluate treatment response

- Imaging
    - TTE with bubble: RVSP >35-40 is concerning for PH. TTE can show evidence of RV dilation and dysfunction (TAPSE <1.6cm), RRA dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion. It should evaluate for classification by quantifying L heart disease and shunt.
    - CT angiogram: evaluates for acute and chronic thrombi using contrast media; consider V/Q scan in setting of AKI and advanced CKD (discuss risk and benefits)
    - V/Q scan: better performance in evaluating small chronic embolism in contrast to CTA
    - High res CT: evaluates parenchymal lung disease, dilation of the pulmonary artery, RV size
 
## Diagnosis

- May be suspected from clinical presentation and indirect surrogate markers of elevated PAP

- A right heart catheterization is the gold standard for PH diagnosis and will differentiate between precapillary and postcapillary PH
    - Nitric oxide challenge during RHC assesses for drug response
    - Fluid challenge with 500ml LR during RHC assesses left heart compliance

## Management

- immunizations: yearly influenza, COVID, pneumococcal

- Counsel to strongly avoid pregnancy

- Identify decompensation triggers: progression of underlying disease, medication/dietary nonadherence, infection, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction/RV ischemia, shunting via PFO, pulmonary embolism

- Treatment: aimed at preventing right heart failure, increasing vasoactive molecules (preventing further remodeling), symptom relief/quality of life, functional class (NYHA class)
    - Oxygenation goal >90%
    - Diuresis: do not be aggressive, these pts are preload dependent

- Consult pulmonary hypertension if considering starting or changing PH medications.

## Medications

- Anticoagulation: For pts with confirmed CTEPH. Should be worked up for hypercoagulability including antiphospholipid syndrome. Pulmonary endarterectomy may be considered.

- Oral CCB: used in pts who had a positive vasoreactive challenge on RHC

- PAH-specific vasoactive medications (in order of escalation)
    - NOenhancers
        - PDE5-inhibitors: sildenafil, tadalafil
        - Soluble guanylate cyclase stimulant: riociguat
    - Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Bosentan, macitenatan, ambrisentan o      - Prostacyclin analogs
        - Prostacyclin analogs increase cAMP-mediated pulmonary vasodilation
        - Side effects include jaw pain, flushing, arthralgias, and diarrhea
        - IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump. Never stop IV
prostacyclins since even brief pauses can cause rebound vasoconstriction and death.
            - Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan); half-life 4 minutes
            - Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO; half-life 4 hours
            - Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes
            - Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours
        - BMPR2-targeted therapies (eg, sotatercept) are under investigation for PAH

- Balloon atrial septostomy: creation of a R->L shunt to offload the RV which reduces SpO2 but overall improved peripheral tissues DO2. Palliative procedure or bridge.

- VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or for lung transplant.

- Lung transplantation can be considered for pts who are candidates and failing maximal medical therapy

- Treatment escalation is based on a pt’s NYHA functional classification
    - Class I: no treatment or monotherapy
    - Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy
    - Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin
    - Class IV: prostacyclin ± oral therapy

## Poor prognostic factors

- NYHA Functional Class III and IV

- 6-minute walk test less than 300 meters

- The present of AKI and/or hyponatremia

- Low SBP (SBP < 90) when connective tissue disease or liver disease is the etiology

- Poor hemodynamics on RHC (right atrial pressure > 20 mmHg; cardiac index less than 2)

- TTE findings: tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, marker of global RV function) < 1.8, the presence of a pericardial effusion, and severe RV dysfunction
