# Interstitial Lung Disease 

Madelaine Behrens

---

## Background

- Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases that involve
    scarring or fibrosis, affecting the lung interstitium, alveoli, and
    pulmonary capillaries

    - Leads to loss of lung volume and compliance and impaired gas
        exchange

    - Radiologic appearance not specific for underlying cause. No cause -> IIP

## Etiologies

- ILD is divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes

- Idiopathic: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia,
    idiopathic NSIP, organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia,
    etc

- Secondary

    - Systemic:

        - Connective tissue disease: RA, Sjogrens, dermatomyositis,
            polymyositis SLE, MCTD, scleroderma

        - Granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis, TB

        - Vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic
            granulomatosis with polyangiitis, amyloidosis,
            lymphangioleiomyomatosis

    - Exposure

        - Pneumoconiosis (inorganic) – exposure to coal mines, silica,
            asbestos, organic solvents, heavy metals, solder, hair dressing
            chemicals

        - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic)- farm exposures, chicken
            coops, pesticide, stored grains, mold (ex: water damage in home,
            hot tubs)

        - Iatrogenic – amiodarone, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors,
            nitrofurantoin, radiation

## Evaluation

- Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are
    uncharacteristic

- Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are uncharacteristic

- Dyspnea (especially on exertion) is also typical of many progressive ILDs.

- Occupational and environmental exposures: pets, dust, hay, grass, molds, organic/inorganic
compounds

- Medications, smoking history, radiation history, family history lung disease

- Autoimmunity and vasculitis symptoms: dysphagia, arthritis, myalgia, rash, Raynaud’s
phenomenon, hematuria, hemoptysis, mononeuritis multiplex

- High resolution CT (image of choice): evaluates the lung parenchyma while pt is supine and prone (to rule out atelectasis), and with inspiratory and expiratory cuts (to identify air trapping - mosaicism worse with expiration)

- Chest Imaging:

    - CXR – could find peripheral reticular opacities

    - HRCT protocol is used for diagnosis: evaluates the lung parenchyma
        while pt is supine, prone, with inspiratory and expiratory cuts

    - There are two morphologic features on HRCT

        - Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): basilar predominant
            fibrosis, honey combing, and traction bronchiectasis. Minimal
            GGOs. Pattern seen in IPF.

        - Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP): Marked by subpleural
            sparing, increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation
            due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing

- Labs without Pulmonology consult
    - ESR, CRP, ANA w/ reflex ENA, RF, CCP
    - CBC with diff: evaluate eosinophilia or cytopenias concerning for autoimmune disease

- Labs in conjunction with Pulmonology
    - Myositis panel: 70% of those with anti-synthetase syndrome will have primary lung pathology without myositis findings, anti-Scl-70 and anti-RNP most commonly
    - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel: should be sent to a highly specialized lab since not all labs use an immunoprecipitation technique (crucial)
    - Histo antigen, blasto antigen, aspergillus galactomannan, 1-3-β-D-glucan, sputum GMS;
consider NTM and HIV
    - PFTs: usually restrictive lung disease
    - Spirometry: expect to see ↓ FEV1 and FVC with FEV1/FVX >0.7
    - Lung volumes: ↓ TLC, RV, and/or FRC
    - DLCO: Gas exchange is generally impaired and worsens with disease progression

- Bronchoscopy and biopsy
    - BAL is not diagnostic ILD: may help understand the underlying inflammatory response (eosinophilic PNA, lymphocytosis of >40% in hypersensitivity pneumonitis) and rule out infection (particularly in organizing PNA)
    - Consider when there is diagnostic uncertainty: indeterminate or non-UIP patterns, more GGOs than anticipated, air trapping indicated HP, or concern for superimposed infection 
    - Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) is usually nondiagnostic in ILD outside of sarcoidosis
or HP. Cryobiopsy can be considered an alternative to surgical lung biopsy for histopathology 

- Other tests to consider
    - 6-minute walk test: prognostic value o TTE to evaluate for pHTN
    - SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration

## Management
- Acute exacerbation (AE-ILD)

- Definition: acute lung injury (new onset bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, PaO2 /FiO2 ≤ 300, and PAWP ≤ 18) in the absence of heart failure, pulmonary infection, pulmonary embolism (PE),
aspiration, or drug reaction

- Chest CT is imaging standard, both to diagnose and also rule out other etiologies of AHRF

- Treat any underlying trigger, support with supplemental oxygen and respiratory therapy

- Generally, UIP pattern (i.e. end-stage fibrosis) is NOT steroid responsive acutely or
chronically.

- Consult pulmonology and rheumatology if CTD-ILD to guide immunosuppression.

- Chronic therapy
  
    - Antifibrotics
      
        - Main utility is in pts with IPF
      
        - Tyrosine kinase inhibition: nintedanib (INBUILD & INPULSIS trials): decreases rate of decline in FVC, no reduction on mortality
            - Adverse effects: abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, weight loss, elevated AST and ALT
              
        - TGF-beta inhibition: pirfenidone (RELIEF & ASCEND trials): May slow rate of decline
 of DLCO and 6MWT distance, no mortality reduction
            - Adverse effects: GI discomfort and photosensitivity
              
    - Immunosuppression
        - MUST rule out infection prior to use 
        - Steroid/immunosuppression responsive (generally): COP, NSIP (cellular subtype), CT- ILD, inflammatory HP, granulomatous inflammation (sarcoidosis, silicosis, berylliosis, etc.), eosinophilic pneumonia, vasculitis-associated ILDs
        - Not steroid responsive: IPF, fibrotic HP
        - There is increased mortality in IPF with azathioprine/prednisone. NAC (PANTHER-
IPF trial)
    
    - Other considerations
        - Smoking cessation
        - Drug removal: consider discontinuing amiodarone, checkpoint inhibitor, etc
        - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: antigen exposure elimination
        - Eosinophilic pneumonia: steroids; biologics can be used (send to Allergy clinic)
        - Consider lung transplant eval for progressive or rapidly decompensating fibrotic lung disease
        - Pulmonary rehabilitation is crucial (trend towards mortality benefit)
