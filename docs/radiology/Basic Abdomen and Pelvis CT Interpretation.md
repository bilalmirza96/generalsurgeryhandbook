# Basic Abdomen and Pelvis CT Interpretation

---

- Structured search pattern and frequent windowing are important for evaluation of various structures and organs in the abdomen and pelvis.
 
- Soft tissue window: for evaluation of solid organ and soft tissue structures
 
- Bone windows: to identify fractures or osseous lesions
  
- Lung windows: to evaluate lung bases. Also helpful for identifying intraperitoneal free air in the abdomen and pelvis.

- Example of routine CT abdomen pelvis search pattern and dictation template:

- Lower chest
  - Lung bases: consolidation, aspiration, atelectasis
  - Pleural effusion, pneumothorax
  - Pericardial effusion

- Liver: assess morphology, enhancement, masses, abscesses, vascular abnormalities, trauma
  - Liver trauma: laceration, hematoma, hemorrhage
    - Laceration: irregular linear/branching areas of hypoattenuation
    - Hematoma: intermediate to hyperdense collection between liver parenchyma and capsule
    - Vascular injury
    - Active hemorrhage: typically hyperdense compared to normal parenchyma

- Gallbladder and Biliary Tract: evaluate for dense gallstones, surrounding fat stranding or fluid, dilated biliary ducts

- Pancreas: assess morphology, enhancement, lesions, ductal dilation, peripancreatic fluid or stranding.
  - Pancreatitis: two subtypes (interstitial edematous [seen in image] and necrotizing)
  - Parenchymal enlargement, alterations in attenuation, indistinct margins, surrounding fat stranding, lack of parenchymal enhancement suggests necrosis

- Spleen: size, enhancement, trauma 

- Adrenal Glands: morphology, masses

- Kidneys and Ureters: renal size, morphology, enhancement, masses, hydronephrosis, hydroureter, renal or ureteral stones.
  - Urolithiasis: distal obstructing ureteral calculus with upstream hydronephrosis
  - Pyelonephritis: wedge-like regions of parenchymal swelling and reduced enhancement relative to normal parenchyma
    - Complications: renal or perinephric abscess, renal papillary necrosis,
emphysematous pyelonephritis (look for bubbly or linear streaks of gas, fluid collections with air-fluid levels)

- Urinary Bladder: not well assessed when decompressed.
  - Assess for wall thickening, masses, intraluminal debris, periserosal fat stranding.

- Gastrointestinal Tract: morphology of distal esophagus and stomach, bowel caliber, wall thickness, masses, mural enhancement, stool burden, appendix
  - Bowel obstruction: Dilated gas or fluid-filled loops of bowel (3-6-9 cm rule for upper limit of normal size for small bowel, colon, and cecum diameter), air-fluid levels, fecal matter in small bowel loops, transition point between dilated and collapsed loops of bowel
  - Bowel perforation: assess for free air, pneumatosis, portal venous gas
  - Pneumatosis intestinalis: Intramural bowel gas. Linear lucencies or rounded bubbly collections.
    - Can be life-threatening secondary to
ischemia, obstruction, enteritis/colitis, organ transplantation. Can also be incidental and secondary to benign etiology, making clinical context crucial.
  - Diverticulitis: Pericolonic fat stranding, segmental bowel wall thickening, mural
hyperenhancement.
    - Complicated diverticulitis: perforation (free air and fluid), abscess formation, fistula
formation (usually a chronic complication).
  - Appendicitis
    - Base of appendix located between the ileocecal valve and apex of the cecum.
    - Location of the tip of the appendix and length of the appendix are variable.
    - Appendiceal dilatation (classically >6mm outer diameter), wall thickening and
enhancement, intraluminal fluid, periappendiceal fat stranding, adjacent cecal thickening.

- Peritoneum: free air, free fluid, fluid collections, peritoneal or omental nodularity/implants
  - Small volume of peritoneal fluid may be physiologic in female pts, particularly around menses.
  - Fluid is generally hypodense. Hyperdense fluid may suggest hemoperitoneum, especially in context of trauma.

- Vasculature: suboptimally assessed without intravenous contrast, best assessed with CT angiography
  - Portal, splenic, superior mesenteric veins: evaluate patency
  - IVC: contrast mixing in IVC can appear similar to a hypodense filling defect. -
  - Abdominal aorta
    - Abdominal aortic aneurysm: focal dilatation >3 cm in maximum transverse diameter.
    - Ruptured AAA: retroperitoneal hemorrhage adjacent to aneurysm, blood extending into perirenal or pararenal spaces or psoas muscles. High attenuation crescent representing acute hematoma within mural thrombus or aneurysm wall suggests impending rupture.
  - Visceral arteries (celiac, splenic, common hepatic, renal, SMA, IMA)
  - Iliac, pelvic, and femoral arteries and veins

- Lymph Nodes: Throughout the abdomen and pelvis. Evaluate size (general guideline is <10mm short axis), morphology, enhancement.
  - Lower chest, upper abdomen (gastrohepatic ligament, celiac, portocaval, porta hepatis), retroperitoneum, mesentery, pelvis (inguinal, mesorectal, sidewall)

- Reproductive Organs: generally not well evaluated with CT, can be used as an adjunct to imaging with ultrasound or MRI
  - Ovarian torsion: enlarged ovary, ovary shifted medially, twisted ovarian pedicle in the adnexa, adnexal fat stranding, underlying ovarian mass.
  - Pelvic inflammatory disease: tubular adnexal “mass”, fallopian tube thickening, uterosacral ligament thickening, complex pelvic free fluid, pelvic fat stranding or haziness.

- Abdominal Wall: hernias, hematomas, solid or cystic masses, skin/soft tissue infection

-Musculoskeletal: important to assess using bone windows
  - Fractures
  - Destructive osseous lesions
  - Degenerative changes
