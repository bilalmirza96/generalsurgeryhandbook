## Background

- Capacity is a patient’s ability to make a specific medical decision at a specific point in time and can be assessed by any physician

- Capacity is fluid and may change with the patient’s mental status and or medical state. A person may have capacity to make one decision and not another

- Competency: “global decision-making capacity” or ability to make financial decisions, etc are legal determinations made by a judge


## Evaluation

- Four key components

    - Consistent choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice

        - “Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the treatment?”

        - “Can you tell me what your decision is?”

    - Understand: Patient must grasp the fundamental meaning of the information communicated by the medical team

        - “Please tell me in your own words what you were told about:

        - The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended treatment

        - The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative treatments and (5) no treatment”

    - Appreciate: patient must appreciate the medical condition and likely consequences of treatment options

        - “What is treatment likely to do for you?”

        - “What do you believe will happen if you’re not treated”

        - “Why do you think this treatment was recommended?”

    - Manipulate: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information

        - “What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?”

        - “How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?”

##Management

- If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity:

    - Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision is non-urgent)

    - Identify surrogate decision maker

- Documenting medical decision-making capacity:

    - Use a dot phrase .Capacity that lists the four components and document your thought process citing evidence from your interview
