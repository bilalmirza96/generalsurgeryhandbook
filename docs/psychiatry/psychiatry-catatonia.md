##Background

- Catatonia is a psychomotor syndrome and is associated with both psychiatric and medical conditions

    - Catatonia can present as hypoactive or hyperactive

    - May be secondary to a medical or psychiatric condition

      - Would recommend AMS workup as appropriate while awaiting psychiatric evaluation

    - Severity can range from mild with subtle abnormalities to severe and possibly fatal 

    - Onset of catatonia can range from hours to days or weeks.

    - Episodes can be acute, chronic and persistent, or periodic and recurring

    - Duration of catatonia related to intoxication or underlying medical conditions relate to the duration of the underlying cause

    - Prevalence estimates vary widely due in large part to a variety of presentations and inconsistent diagnosis

      - Estimates range from 10-30%
        
##Evaluation

- Presentations are often varied, so early psychiatric intervention is important given possibility of autonomic instability that can be fatal

    -  If catatonia is considered on the differential, a psychiatric consultation is encouraged early-on.

- Catatonia can include quantitative changes in psychomotor activity and qualitatively bizarre behaviors

    - Some clues may include increased muscle tone, decreased speech production, decreased PO intake, abnormal movements or behaviors that do not seem goal-oriented, maintaining odd postures, refusing to follow commands, repetitive movements such as pacing, repeating phrases, or grimacing

      - hypoactive catatonia specifically can present as a quantitative decrease in psychomotor activity and includes paucity of movement, including immobility, staring, mutism, rigidity, withdrawal and refusal to eat, ambitendency, and negativism

      - Excited catatonia, specifically, includes severe psychomotor agitation, impulsivity, and combativeness

      - Abnormal psychomotor activity can be seen in both hypoactive and excited catatonia and can include posturing, grimacing, waxy flexibility, echolalia or echopraxia, stereotypy, verbigeration, and automatic obedience

##Treatment

- Early psychiatry consultation is important due to thorough evaluation of catatonia involving response to treatment (diagnostic and therapeutic)

- Reversal and treatment of underlying causes of catatonia.

- First line treatment for catatonia is benzodiazepines

    - Often lorazepam 2 mg IV 

- Response to treatment can be rapid within minutes 

    - Early psychiatry involvement is important for this reason for full evaluation of symptoms before and after intervention

- Treatment with benzodiazepines and/or ECT often continues for weeks to months following initial diagnosis
