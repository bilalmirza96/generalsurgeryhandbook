# Substance Use Disorder (SUD)

## Background

- SUDs are common, complex, and chronic neuropsychiatric disorders with well-described
inherited risk, dysregulated neurophysiology, and multiple effective treatment modalities

- Patients with SUD face significant stigma, prior traumatic experiences in healthcare
environments
    - Using the term “abuse” undermines the disease model of addiction and perpetuates
stigma
    - Person-centered, specific terminology: “Person with opioid and alcohol use disorders”
      
- Avoid the qualifier “Polysubstance.” Instead, clarify specific diagnoses for each substance category
  
- DSM 5 Criteria (same for most substance categories): Requires 2+ criteria met in past year and the patient’s use must cause clinically significant impairment and/or distress:
    - Loss of control: Larger amounts, longer time, ongoing use despite consequences, efforts/desire to reduce use
    - Physiologic changes: Tolerance, withdrawal (these 2 alone do not necessarily imply a disorder if they result from prescribed therapy), craving
    - Consequences: hazardous use, interpersonal problems, medical problems, failed role obligations, lost activities

## Management

- First priority in the inpatient medical setting is to identify and stabilize withdrawal states
    - Mitigate risks of severe sequelae (seizure, delirium)
    - Avoid unintended iatrogenic harm (e.g. opioid abstinence leading to lost tolerance and post-discharge overdose)
    - Avoid distress-driven AMA discharge (discrimination resulting from stigma)
      
- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for:
    - Management of complex withdrawal states
    - Substance use disorders and co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses
    - Assistance with risk stratification for discharge with PICC lines for outpatient antibiotics and/or people who continue to use illicit substances while hospitalized
    -  Differentiation of pain requiring opioid therapy and opioid use disorder
    -  Harm reduction resources
- If in the emergency room and not admitted, consult PAS
