# Inpatient Insomnia

## Background

- Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial

- Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition,
    behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function,
    inflammation, and metabolism

## Management

- Non-pharmacologic interventions (when medically appropriate):

    - Minimize: 

        - Potential for overnight alarms (telemetry etc.)

        - Overnight vital signs

        - Overnight and early morning lab draws

        - Overnight IV fluids and late-night diuretics

    - Discourage daytime naps

    - Administer nighttime medications earlier in the evening

    - Turn off or mute the television

    - Close room doors

    - Encourage care team to be as quite as possible overnight

    - Keeps lights on during the day and off at night

    - Ensure patient has CPAP available if used at home

- Pharmacotherapy:

   - Background

        - The best first step is to minimize medications such as sedative-hypnotics, opioids, glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb sleep architecture

    - Medications

        - Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs

            - First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian rhythms; Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime

        - Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day)

            - Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea

            - Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use lowest effective dose

        - Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS

            - A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism

            - Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary depression

            - Can increase appetite and cause weight gain

## Additional Information

- Avoid the following in the inpatient setting:

    - Benzodiazepines

        - Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided
            due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression,
            cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls,
            particularly in hospitalized older adults

    - Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g.,
        zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon)

        - Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with
            cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized
            patients

    - Diphenhydramine

        - Trials evaluating their effectiveness as sleep aids are limited
            and show mixed results

        - Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient
            setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects
            (constipation, urinary retention)
