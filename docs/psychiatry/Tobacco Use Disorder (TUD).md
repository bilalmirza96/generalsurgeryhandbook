# Tobacco Use Disorder (TUD)

Ben Johnson

## Background

- All patients should be screened for nicotine use (smoking, chewing, and vaping of nicotine
containing products)

- Nicotine withdrawal is one of the most common reasons that patients leave the hospital before
medically advised

- Hospitalized patients receiving pharmacotherapy for nicotine use have higher rates of
cessation

## Management

- Combination therapy is superior to single therapy alone

- Basal:
  - Transdermal nicotine patch provides sustained levels of nicotine
  - > 10 cigarettes (1/2 pack) per day: 21 mg patch
  - < 10 cigarettes (1/2 pack) per day: 14 mg patch
  - Remove overnight, abnormal dreams and nightmares are a common if not removed

- Bolus
  - Gum/ Lozenge provides immediate nicotine for breakthrough cravings 
  - First cigarette within 30 minutes of waking: 4 mg gum/lozenge
  - First cigarette after 30 minutes of waking: 2 mg gum/lozenge
    - Patients smoking 1+ packs per day will likely still require 4 mg gum/lozenge
  - Order q1h prn as patients will titrate utilization as they would with their outpatient
nicotine use
  - Chew and park method for nicotine gum; sublingual absorption needed to bypass first
metabolism

- Other medications 
  - Varenicline
    - Equivalent efficacy to combination NRT for smoking cessation
    - Limited utility in the inpatient setting due to side effect tolerability and need for dose
titration over multiple days

  - Bupropion
    - Effective but less efficacious than combination NRT and varenicline
    - Limited utility in the inpatient setting due to dose titration over a week and delay in
steady state blood levels    
    - Contraindicated in those with seizure disorder and those at risk of seizures
