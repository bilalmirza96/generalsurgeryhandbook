#Navigating "Difficult" Pt Interactions

Katherine Termini and Jonathan Smith

## Background
- Between 15-60% of pt-physician interactions are considered “difficult” by the physician. Pts in
these interactions also often report dissatisfaction, feeling unheardor uncared for.
- Pts want to feel their unique perspective is understood by their team, even if that perspective
differs from the team. Reaching this understanding can often resolve conflict.
- Difficult pt interactions increase the risk for physician burnout.
- It is important to note that most difficult interactions are not due to psychiatric illness.

## Communication Tips
- When a pt has very strong affect towards you, try not to take this personally as it is rarely
related to you specifically.
- Remain calm and unflappable while in the room, even if the pt is upset. Focus on breathing
deeply and pause before speaking.
- Attempt to identify and verbally reflect the pt’s emotional state.
- Understand that you cannot reason someone out of something he/she was not reasoned into
- Minimize blaming and “you” statements
- Acknowledge that being in the hospital is hard work for the pt, and the team wants to work
with the pt toward a common goal.
- Acknowledge that the interaction/relationship is less than ideal and how that may be
impacting their care.
- Assist a pt in revising unrealistic expectations by providing education, but always keep the
reason for their expectations at the center (refusing a procedure due to fear of death or feeling
out of control).
- Indicate the pt’s own role and responsibilities in their care—highlight the things that they have
direct control over.

## Angry Pts: The 5 A’s
- Acknowledge the problem and pt’s anger
- Allow the pt to vent uninterrupted
- Agree on what the root problem is
- Affirm what can be done to address this problem
- Assure follow-through
- That said, prioritize safety of pts and staff. If the pt is escalating to physical agitation, defer
negotiations to a later time. Do not stay in the room if you feel that your physical safety is in danger or if the pt is being verbally assaultive. You never need the pt’s permission to leave the room.

## Splitting
- A coping mechanism by which a pt views others as either good or bad without middle ground
- This often manifests as different team members having different types of interactions with the
pt or hearing different things from the pt. The pt may idealize some team members and
villainize others.
- If possible, have all team members (primary, consultants, bedside nurse) meet with the pt at
the same time.
  - Alternatively, have all treatment plans be delivered by one central person (primary
resident) with bedside nurse present
- Provide pt a written summary of this plan.
- Find ways to make small, reasonable concessions that give the pt more control over their care
and day-to-day experience (e.g. shifting the timing of medications).
- Set clear expectations and boundaries (e.g. team will terminate discussion and leave the room
if the pt begins cursing at them) and follow-through on them
- When feeling stuck, consulting the psychiatry consultation liason service can help address
psychiatric factors that may be contributing or can play a mediating role
