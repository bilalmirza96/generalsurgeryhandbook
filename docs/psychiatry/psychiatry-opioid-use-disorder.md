# Opioid Use Disorder 

Ben Johnson
--- 

## Background

- Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid therapy)
  
- Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for inpatients; buprenorphine can also now be prescribed at discharge by any physician, though methadone for OUD must be dispensed directly from a federally regulated Opioid Treatment Program (“methadone clinic”)
  
- Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with preference for an “opt- out” approach (even for uninsured patients through state grant funding)
  
## Presentation (Withdrawal)

- Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea, abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, chills, insomnia, yawning
- Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion, diaphoresis, restless legs

## Evaluation

- Due to the partial agonist mu-opioid effect of buprenorphine and high binding affinity,
premature induction of buprenorphine in patients previously using full-agonist opioids
rapidly induces a withdrawal state (precipitated withdrawal)

- Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of opioid withdrawal and
allows for safer buprenorphine inductions
    - Approximates the mu opioid receptor availability to avoid premature induction and
precipitated withdrawal in the setting of buprenorphine induction while also allowing for
adequate treatment of withdrawal symptoms

- Asking about opioid exposure: “You’re uncomfortable. I work with a lot of people in the
hospital, and some come with regular exposure to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends), should we be treating any withdrawal for you?”

# Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

## Buprenorphine

Background

- Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity
  
- Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing
  
- TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect is shorter-lived)
  
- OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury or switch to monoptoduct buprenorphine (Child-Pugh Class C)
  
- All non-pregnant patients should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g. Suboxone)
formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection

Management

- Induction:
    - All opioid medication must be held 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9 AM), and recorded COWS score > 10 to mitigate risk of precipitated withdrawal
    - 2-4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 2-4 mg is given q1h up to a total of 12 mg in first day
        - Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose o Typical starting dose: 12-16mg/day SL
        - 
- Maintenance:
    - 4-32mg SL daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use, 24 mg is sufficient in most cases
    - All patient on Suboxone must have a prescription at discharge and a follow-up
appointment for continued outpatient treatment PSYCHIATRY
        - No DEA waiver required; any physician may prescribe buprenorphine for OUD at discharge
          
- Acute pain management in patients using buprenorphine:
   - There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for breakthrough pain
        - If the etiology of pts pain would require opioid therapy in a non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely in the hospital
    - Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced and split doses (4mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and cravings, but NOT manage new pain
    - Post-operatively: Reduce opioid requirements and increase buprenorphine to home dose
      - If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction procedure to avoid

## Methadone

Background

- Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity
  
- Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine induction procedure or with significant chronic or escalating pain
  
- Long half life: 12-36 hrs
    - Limit titration to 10mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and delayed overdose
    - eg: 40 mg po qd increased to 50 mg po qd for one week prior to further titration to 60 mg po qd
      
- Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury
  
- Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc monitoring
  
Management

- Induction:
    - In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or hypopnea
    - Lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or concurrent CNS depressant
therapy
    - First dose cannot exceed 30 mg, and no more than 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while admitted
        - Federally regulated titration limits
          
- Maintenance:
    - Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient dose
    - Until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours)
    - After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose or divide if patient is
experiencing an acute pain generator or has a medical reason for induction of metabolism (eg pregnancy may require split dosing in the 2nd/3rd trimester; medication interactions may have similar effects or require dose reduction if metabolism is inhibited)

## Naltrexone

- Mu opioid antagonist
  
- Half-life oral ~4 hours but clinically active ~24 hrs
  
- IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days (not available for inpatient
administration)

- Only IM formulation is evidence-based to prevent return-to-use of illicit opioids, though PO formulation can be useful to introduce medication
  
- Can precipitate withdrawal
  
- Requires 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation

- If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral formulation (50mg po qd) until discharged to outpatient provider to receive injection

Additional Information
- Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD:
    - Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help, 12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term residential treatment
      
- Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD; however, should encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially benzodiazepines)
  
- Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status
