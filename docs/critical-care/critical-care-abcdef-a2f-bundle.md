# ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle

## Background
-	Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS): complex constellation of cognitive, physical, and psychological impairments that impact most survivors of critical illness, leading to disability, frailty, and poor quality of life
    -	Predicted by (1) duration of immobility and (2) delirium
    -	Both are reduced by >80% compliance with ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle concepts
-	ABCDEF (A2F) Bundle: Interprofessional, evidence-based safety bundle of care principles to help reduce LOS, mortality, bounce-backs, and the duration of ICU delirium and coma
-	Goal: allow pt to “prove us wrong” about readiness for liberation from devices, sedatives, etc.

## Assess, prevent, and manage pain
-	Tools to assess pain using facial expressions, body movements, muscle tension, compliance with ventilator, or vocalization for extubated pts
    -	Ex: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT): scale 0-8, uncontrolled pain >=3 
-	Uncontrolled pain increases risk for delirium, limits inspiratory effort & weaning from ventilator, and limits ability to mobilize
-	Treatment: multi-modal: parenteral opioids, neuropathic meds (e.g., gabapentin, ketamine), adjunctive non-opioids analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen, NSAIDs), nonpharmacologic interventions (repositioning, heat/cold)

## Both spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBTs)
-	SATs = daily sedative interruptions
    -	RN-driven protocol involving safety checklist: no active seizures, alcohol withdrawal, agitation, paralytics, myocardial infarction, or increased ICP
    -	If pass SAT, proceed to SBT
    -	If fail SAT (anxiety, agitation, pain, resp distress)  restart sedation at ½ doses
-	SBTs = PS ventilation (Fi02 ≤ 50%, PEEP ≤ 7.5; typically 40% and 5/5) for ≥ 30 minutes
    -	RT or physician/APP-driven protocol with safety screen: passed SAT, O2 sat ≥ 88%, inspiratory efforts, no myocardial ischemia, no/low vasopressor support
    -	If pass SBT, physician/APP judgment on extubation
    -	If fail SBT (RR > 35 or < 8, O2 sat < 88%, resp distress, mental status change)  restart full ventilatory support
-	Evidence:
    -	Liberated pts from mechanical ventilation 3 days sooner, decreased ICU and hospital length of stay by 4 days, and 14% absolute reduction in mortality at 1 year

## Choice of analgesia and sedation
-	Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): sedation & level of arousal assessment tool (Figure 1)
    -	Target light sedation of RASS -1 to 0 with goal of (1) pt following commands without agitation and (2) limiting immobilization
    -	Over-sedation:  hold sedatives till target, then restart at ½ prior dose 
-	Analgosedation with focus on treating pain first and then adding sedation meds PRN
-	Sedatives: dexmedetomidine (dex) or propofol >>> benzodiazepines (increased delirium risk)

## Delirium- assess, prevent, and manage
-	Screening for delirium: q4h using CAM-ICU (Figure 2)
    -	Affects 60-80% of ventilated pts and associated with increased morbidity and mortality, longer ICU and hospital length of stay, long-term cognitive dysfunction
-	Risk factors and treatment: see Delirium section in Psychiatry 

## Early mobility and exercise
-	Prolonged immobilization during critical illness leads to ICU-acquired weakness, associated with worse outcomes: ↑ mechanical ventilation, increased hosp length of stay, greater mortality, and greater disability
-	Consult PT/OT to initiate rehab at the beginning of critical illness
    -	Can be done safely in pts receiving advanced support

## Family engagement and empowerment
- Especially important when pts are unable to communicate themselves
- Incorporate family at the bedside and on rounds to learn pt preferences and values, engage in shared-decision making, and address questions and concerns
