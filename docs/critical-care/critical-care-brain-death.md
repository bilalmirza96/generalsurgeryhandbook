# Brain Death

Anna Berry

## Background
-	Brain death= complete and permanent loss of brain function. Defined by coma with loss of capacity for consciousness, brainstem reflexes, and the ability to breathe independently

## Checklist for Determination of Brain Death (American Academy of Neurology)

### 1. Prerequisites (all must be checked)
-	Coma, irreversible and cause known
-	Neuroimaging explains coma – usually CT or MRI
-	Absence of CNS depressing drugs
-	No evidence of residual paralytics (electrical stimulation if paralytics used)
-	Absence of severe acid-base, electrolyte, endocrine abnormality
-	Normothermia or mild hypothermia (core temp >36°C)
-	SBP ≥100 mmHg
-	No spontaneous respirations

### 2. Examination (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present for brain death exam


| **Test**                       | **Regions Tested**                          | **Indications of Brain Death**                                                                           | **Cautions**                                                                                             |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consciousness**              | Rostral brainstem, thalamus, bilateral cerebral hemispheres | No response to noxious auditory, visual, or tactile stimulation                                           | Use of adequate stimulation is important, including noxious tactile stimulus of the cranium (supra-orbital notch and temporomandibular joint, intra-nasal stimulation) as well as the torso and limbs |
| **Pupillary reflex**           | Upper brainstem                             | No response to bright light                                                                               | Use of medications may affect pupillary reactivity History of corneal trauma or ophthalmic surgery may affect reactivity Quantitative pupillometry may be a useful adjunct for detection of subtle reactivity |
| **Corneal reflex**             | Middle-to-upper brainstem                   | No eyelid response when pressure is applied at the border of iris with a cotton swab on a stick            | Use of adequate pressure should be ensured; the lateral conjunctiva, which is less sensitive than the proximal conjunctiva, should be avoided |
| **Oculocephalic reflex ("doll's eye" maneuver)** | Middle brainstem                             | No eye movement with head turning                                                                         | Use of this approach should be avoided when the integrity of the cervical spine is questionable            |
| **Oculovestibular reflex ("cold caloric" reflex test)** | Middle brainstem                             | No eye movement within 60 seconds of instillation of ice water                                            | Clear pathway to intact tympanic membrane should be ensured; head should be elevated to an angle of 30 degrees; wait 5 minutes between testing of each ear |
| **Gag reflex**                 | Lower brainstem                             | No gag reflex in response to bilateral stimulation of the posterior pharynx with a tongue depressor or suction catheter | Avoid manipulation of endotracheal tube, if present                                                       |
| **Cough reflex**               | Lower brainstem                             | No cough in response to deep bronchial suctioning                                                        | May be absent in patients with phrenic nerve palsy resulting from injury to the cervical cord               |
| **Motor response**             | Brainstem, cerebral hemispheres             | No cerebrally mediated response to deep nail-bed pressure or proximal stimulation of trunk or arms and legs | May be difficult to distinguish spinally mediated responses from cerebrally mediated responses; expertise and, in some instances, ancillary testing may be required |

### 3. Apnea testing (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present
-	Pt is hemodynamically stable
-	Ventilator adjusted to provide normocarbia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg)
-	Preoxygenate with 100% FiO2 and PEEP of 5 cmH2O for >10 min to PaO2 >200 mmHg
-	Provide oxygen via a suction catheter to the level of the carina at 6 L/min or attach T-piece with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 cmH2O
-	Disconnect ventilator
-	Spontaneous respirations absent
-	Arterial blood gas drawn at 8–10 minutes, pt reconnected to ventilator
    -	PCO2 ≥60 mmHg, or 20 mmHg rise from normal baseline value; OR:
    -	Apnea test aborted due to spontaneous respirations present, hemodynamic instability, or hypoxia 

### 4. Ancillary testing (Order one test if clinical examination cannot be fully performed due to pt factors or if apnea testing inconclusive/aborted)
-	Cerebral angiogram
-	HMPAO SPECT (Single photon emission computed tomography)
-	EEG & TCD (transcranial Doppler)

## Organ donation caveats 
-	Discussions about organ donation should take place between Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) and the surrogate. You SHOULD NOT be having conversations with the surrogate about donation. Direct questions to TDS
