# Brain Death

## Background
-	Brain death= complete and permanent loss of brain function. Defined by coma with loss of capacity for consciousness, brainstem reflexes, and the ability to breathe independently

## Checklist for Determination of Brain Death (American Academy of Neurology)

### 1. Prerequisites (all must be checked)
-	Coma, irreversible and cause known
-	Neuroimaging explains coma – usually CT or MRI
-	Absence of CNS depressing drugs
-	No evidence of residual paralytics (electrical stimulation if paralytics used)
-	Absence of severe acid-base, electrolyte, endocrine abnormality
-	Normothermia or mild hypothermia (core temp >36°C)
-	SBP ≥100 mmHg
-	No spontaneous respirations

### 2. Examination (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present for brain death exam

### 3. Apnea testing (all must be checked) – Attending MUST be present
-	Pt is hemodynamically stable
-	Ventilator adjusted to provide normocarbia (PaCO2 35–45 mmHg)
-	Preoxygenate with 100% FiO2 and PEEP of 5 cmH2O for >10 min to PaO2 >200 mmHg
-	Provide oxygen via a suction catheter to the level of the carina at 6 L/min or attach T-piece with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) at 10 cmH2O
-	Disconnect ventilator
-	Spontaneous respirations absent
-	Arterial blood gas drawn at 8–10 minutes, pt reconnected to ventilator
    -	PCO2 ≥60 mmHg, or 20 mmHg rise from normal baseline value; OR:
    -	Apnea test aborted due to spontaneous respirations present, hemodynamic instability, or hypoxia 

### 4. Ancillary testing (Order one test if clinical examination cannot be fully performed due to pt factors or if apnea testing inconclusive/aborted)
-	Cerebral angiogram
-	HMPAO SPECT (Single photon emission computed tomography)
-	EEG & TCD (transcranial Doppler)

## Organ donation caveats 
-	Discussions about organ donation should take place between Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) and the surrogate. You SHOULD NOT be having conversations with the surrogate about donation. Direct questions to TDS
