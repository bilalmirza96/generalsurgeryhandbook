# High Quality Handovers

Christine Hamilton

---

## Synopsis
- Include patient's name, age, pertinent medical history, and key
    hospital diagnoses/events. For example: "John Doe is a 57-year-old
    man with a past medical history of HTN and HLD who presented with
    NSTEMI, now s/p LHC on 3/7, on DAPT.

- Include code status and, if applicable, capacity to leave AMA

## To-dos

- Should be very specific, and instructions should contain the time a
    task should be performed, the task itself, and actionable
    recommendations. For example: "21:00 -- Follow-up intake/output. If
    urine output is less than 2L, order 160mg IV Lasix."

## Contingencies

- Should include instructions for common overnight pages as well as
    patient-specific recommendations. At a minimum, contingencies should
    address: pain, fever, nausea, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability,
    tachycardia, and AMS.

## I-PASS   
 - When giving verbal handoff for complicated patients, use the I-PASS
    technique:

    - I: Illness severity (stable, watcher, unstable)
  
    - P: Patient summary (one-liner with working/confirmed diagnosis, key
      elements of hospital course including major medication
      changes/procedures/interventions, and any pertinent physical exam
      findings or lab result (important particularly if a patient has
      known neuro exam findings, baseline severe hyponatremia, etc in the
      event they are called about this)
  
    - A: Action list: formatted as to-do's, above
  
    - S: Situation awareness: i.e., contingency planning
  
    - S: Synthesis by receiver: summarize the pertinent diagnoses, action
      list, and clarify any questions
